🚀 What is ApiforgeX?

ApiforgeX is not just a code generator; it's an Agentic DevOps Pipeline in a Box.

Backend development involves repetitive boilerplate: setting up Express, configuring Prisma, writing CRUD controllers, and managing deployments. ApiforgeX automates 100% of this.

✨ Key Features (The "Product" Promise)

🗣️ Natural Language Input: Just say "I need a blog API with posts and comments".

🧠 AI Architect (Oumi): Our specialized model designs a strict, valid Database Schema (no hallucinations).

🏗️ Auto-Scaffolding: Generates TypeScript, Express, Prisma, and Docker configurations instantly.

🤖 Automated Code Review: Every line is audited by CodeRabbit AI before merging.

🚀 Instant Deployment: Automatically deploys to Vercel serverless functions.

🔔 Real-time Updates: Get Slack notifications for every build step.

🛠️ How It Works (The Architecture)

ApiforgeX combines the power of best-in-class developer tools:

Interface: Cline (VS Code) acts as the pilot.

Orchestrator: Kestra manages the lifecycle (Generate -> Test -> Deploy).

Intelligence: Ollama (Llama 3.2) generates the logic.

Quality: CodeRabbit ensures code health.

Hosting: Vercel serves the API globally.

⚡ Quick Start

Prerequisites

Node.js 18+

Docker & Docker Compose (for Kestra)

GitHub Token & Vercel Token

**Important**: You must install the [CodeRabbit GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai) on your target repository for the automated review cycle to work.

1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone [https://github.com/shubham-01-star/ApiforgeX.git](https://github.com/shubham-01-star/ApiforgeX.git)
cd ApiforgeX
npm install


2. Start the Orchestrator

Launch Kestra in a local container:

docker-compose up -d


Visit http://localhost:8080 to see the dashboard.

3. Run the Agent

You can run the CLI directly or trigger it via Kestra:

# Direct CLI Mode
npm start -- generate --prompt "A task management app" --db postgresql

Integration Details

### Kestra
> [Kestra](https://kestra.io) Orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline, manages Docker containers, and handles Slack notifications. The heart of our autonomous workflow.

### Cline
> [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) acts as the pilot and primary interface. We built a custom MCP Server (`src/mcp/server.ts`) to allow Cline to trigger complex Kestra workflows using natural language.

### Oumi
> [Oumi](https://oumi.ai) is used for **Data Synthesis**. We capture the logs and prompts from our agents to build a fine-tuning dataset, preparing for future self-improvement cycles.

### CodeRabbit
> [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) is our autonomous QA engineer. It reviews every Pull Request generated by the agent. Our "Watcher" script (`watcher.ts`) parses CodeRabbit's feedback to auto-trigger fixes.

### Vercel
> [Vercel](https://vercel.com) provides instant serverless deployment. Every successful merge in our pipeline automatically deploys the generated API to production.

### 3. Configure Cline (MCP)
To enable the Agentic capabilities in VS Code:
1. Open Cline Settings -> **MCP Servers**.
2. Copy the content from `cline_mcp_config.json` in this repo.
3. Paste it into your Cline MCP Settings file.
4. **Update the Environment Variables** (GITHUB_TOKEN, SLACK_WEBHOOK etc.) with your real credentials.
5. Ensure the project is built: `npm run build`.

Now you can ask Cline:
> "Generate a new library management project."
