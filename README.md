🚀 What is ApiforgeX?

ApiforgeX is not just a code generator; it's an Agentic DevOps Pipeline in a Box.

Backend development involves repetitive boilerplate: setting up Express, configuring Prisma, writing CRUD controllers, and managing deployments. ApiforgeX automates 100% of this using a local-first, agentic workflow.

✨ Key Features (The "Product" Promise)

🗣️ Natural Language Input: Just say "I need a blog API with posts and comments".

🧠 AI Architect (Oumi): Our specialized model designs a strict, valid Database Schema (no hallucinations).

🏗️ Auto-Scaffolding: Generates TypeScript, Express, Prisma, and Docker configurations instantly.

🤖 Automated Code Review: Every line is audited by CodeRabbit AI before merging.

🚀 Instant Deployment: Automatically deploys to Vercel serverless functions.

🔔 Real-time Updates: Get Slack notifications for every build step via Kestra.

🛠️ How It Works (The Architecture)

ApiforgeX combines the power of best-in-class developer tools to create an autonomous loop:

Role

Tech Stack

Responsibility

Interface

Cline (VS Code)

Acts as the pilot to trigger workflows from your editor.

Orchestrator

Kestra

Manages the entire lifecycle (Generate -> Test -> Deploy).

Intelligence

Ollama (Llama 3.2)

Runs locally to generate logic and scaffold code.

Architect

Oumi

specialized model for strict JSON schema design.

Quality

CodeRabbit

Ensures code health via automated PR reviews.

Hosting

Vercel

Serves the generated API globally.

⚡ Quick Start

Prerequisites

Node.js: v18.0.0 or higher

Docker & Docker Compose: (Required for Kestra local orchestration)

Tokens: GitHub Token & Vercel Token

GitHub App: You must install the CodeRabbit GitHub App on your target repository.

1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone [https://github.com/shubham-01-star/ApiforgeX.git](https://github.com/shubham-01-star/ApiforgeX.git)
cd ApiforgeX
npm install


2. Start the Orchestrator

Launch Kestra in a local container to manage the agents:

docker-compose up -d


Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your Kestra dashboard.

3. Run the Agent

You can run the CLI directly or trigger it via Kestra:

# Direct CLI Mode
npm start -- generate --prompt "A task management app" --db postgresql


🤝 Configure Cline (MCP)

To enable the Agentic capabilities directly inside VS Code:

Open Cline Settings -> MCP Servers.

Copy the content from cline_mcp_config.json provided in this repo.

Paste it into your Cline MCP Settings file.

Update the Environment Variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, SLACK_WEBHOOK, etc.) with your real credentials.

Ensure the project is built:

npm run build


Now you can simply ask Cline:

"Generate a new library management project."

🏆 Hackathon Tracks

We are proudly building on top of the following sponsor technologies:

🟣 Kestra

Kestra Orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline, manages Docker containers, and handles Slack notifications. It is the heart of our autonomous workflow.

🤖 Cline

Cline acts as the pilot and primary interface. We built a custom MCP Server (src/mcp/server.ts) to allow Cline to trigger complex Kestra workflows using natural language.

🧠 Oumi

Oumi is used for Data Synthesis. We capture the logs and prompts from our agents to build a fine-tuning dataset, preparing for future self-improvement cycles.

🐇 CodeRabbit

CodeRabbit is our autonomous QA engineer. It reviews every Pull Request generated by the agent. Our "Watcher" script (watcher.ts) parses CodeRabbit's feedback to auto-trigger fixes.

▲ Vercel

Vercel provides instant serverless deployment. Every successful merge in our pipeline automatically deploys the generated API to production.
